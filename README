DataDeck is in development while dpm is also under heavy development. Please note that dpm may have not been
"officially" released when you try DataDeck. Therefore, dpm has been pulled out from the dependency check.
Please be sure to obtain dpm at https://github.com/okfn/dpm if it has not already been published elsewhere.
