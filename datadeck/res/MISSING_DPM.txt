DataDeck is built around the dpm project by the Open Knowledge Foundation.
Unfortunately, it appears that dpm is missing from your system.
Here are some ways to obtain it:
- dpm official repository -- https://github.com/okfn/dpm
- Through PyPI (if it is already available) -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dpm

Please install dpm first.
